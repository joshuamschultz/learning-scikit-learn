# Learning Scikit-Learn by Example

This repo is a collection of exercises I have undergone in order to
* test and experiment with sklearn's capability
* try commands to see what the output is and how to use it for next steps
* learn various models
* learn enhacements such as regularization
* put together various ensemble models
